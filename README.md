# Fractal Tree
[Website](https://greydanus.github.io/fractal_tree/index.html)

The physics of a tree blowing in the wind is very difficult to model because the system is highly nonlinear. I made a numerical model of the system by expressing it as a fractal.

## Details
I made an <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/greydanus/fractal_tree/blob/master/phase_space.ipynb">ipython notebook</a> to analyze the motion of this tree more rigorously for my applied math course.
