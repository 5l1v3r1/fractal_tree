# Physics Tree
[Website](https://greydanus.github.io/physics_tree/index.html)

I was walking to class one day when I saw a tree blowing in the wind. Physics must have been on my mind because suddenly I saw each branch, twig, and leaf as a simple harmonic oscillator. I decided to make a numerical model of the nonlinear system.

## Details
I wrote the project in pure JavaScript. I took the animations for the canvas and the Vec class from another one of my projects, Friendly qLearning. Not all the physics is correct for this model; keep in mind that it is a work in progress.
