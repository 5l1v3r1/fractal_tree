# Fractal Tree
[Website](https://greydanus.github.io/fractal_tree/index.html)

The physical phenomenon of a tree blowing in the wind is common but rarely analyzed by physicists and mathemeticians because it is very difficult to model the large number of nonlinear interactions. The motion of a given branch, for example, is determined not only by external forces, but also by the motions of its parent branch and any child branches. One way to understand this system is to model the entire tree as a fractal and then add dynamics to each node of the fractal.

## Details
I made an <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/greydanus/fractal_tree/blob/master/phase_space.ipynb">ipython notebook</a> to analyze the motion of this tree more rigorously for my applied math course.
